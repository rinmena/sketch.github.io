Title: P5.Js sketch
Semester/Year: Fall 2023
Coding/programming languages: P5.js (JavaScript)

For a lack of ideas, I took the liberty of basing my sketch off of the provided example as the night sky with stars twinkling. Then, taking initiative, I added some changes and to add a layer of interactivity and custom coding, I looked into the "mousePressed" event and created a scene switching mechanism, allowing for the sketch to switch between the night sky and a brand new day time setting created seperately by simply clicking anywhere on the sketch. The hardest part was getting the True/False checks to work properly as sometimes it wouldn't check or would fail to check all together, which was promptly solved with a bit of google searching and seeing a couple examples over the internet
